<p>We asked Preeti to be a part of Office Hours for a number of different reasons but the main one being that he is actively shaping Chinatown for the genuine benefit of its kids. It just so happens that he has made a success of everything else he is a part of. </p>

<p>Preeti's interview was the first in this series and originally aired on October 26, 2018.</p>

<p>Preeti Sriratana has over 10 years of experience in commercial architecture, and served as one of the original Senior Designers of Ground Zero, the NY Jets Training Facility, and Masa Restaurants worldwide. He is also the Chairman of Apex for Youth, NYCâ€™s largest non-profit youth organization that empowers children from underserved Asian and immigrant communities, where he co-founded Central Queens Academy, a charter school. Preeti received a Bachelor of Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, a Master of Architecture from Columbia University, a Master in Public Policy from Harvard University, and holds an Official Commendation from the City of New York.</p>
