<p>Contrary to a lot of our other guests, Joel moved from starting his own company into a large scale corporate environment. He talks to us about "flattening heirarchies" and breaking down time to build up slowly, which brings joy and meaning to the incredible work he makes.</p>  

<p>Joel was joined by his friend, collaborator, and fellow designer Laura Coombs for part of the interview, which originally aired on November 15, 2018.</p>

<p>Joel Evey is a visual maker. He has recently rebuilt the creative team at the GAP in New York, as Global Senior Creative Director. Under his lead, this team is focused on reimagining the classic American brand. Prior to GAP, Joel was an Art Director for Need Supply Company and Urban Outfitters, collaboratively creating an era in Urban Outfitters’s history known for its prolific output of experimental books, playful zines, and saturated posters. Joel is also the founder and creative director of his own companies, Pathh and Lighht, working with brands and institutions including Nike, Levi’s, Bloomberg Business Week, and the ICA Philadelphia, among many others. Originally from California, Joel studied graphic design at CalArts, and as an independent educator, has been a critic or lectured at UPenn, SUNY Purchase, Pratt, MICA, CalArts, and more. His honors, self-published works, and additional side projects are too numerous to name. Joel lives between New York and Philadelphia, and drives a 1980 El Camino named Henrietta.</p>
