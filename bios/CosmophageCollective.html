<p>To Cosmophage Collective, food is a designed sensory experience and not just something you eat. Jemma and Jimmy started out our third Food Friday for Office Hours.</p>

<p>Cosmophage Collective's interview originally aired on November 9, 2018.</p>

<p>Jemma Rose Brown is a conceptual artist and producer. Her practice is shaped by a career working in radio and podcasting, and a deep fascination with personal narratives. Her tactile works interplay multiple mediums—interview, cooking, scent and audio storytelling—to challenge ideas of proximity and distance.</p>

<p>Jimmy Tran is an anti-disciplinary experience designer and practitioner of the applied arts. His contributions are a unique concatenation of his immersive studies in architecture, gastronomy, environmental design, physical computing, textile science, oenology, and horticulture. He seeks to tailor human experiences by engaging each of the senses and addressing a deeper level of consciousness.</p>
