<p>Jing Liu cofounded SO – IL with Florian Idenburg in 2008, emphasizing mission-driven cultural projects as an integral part of the urban fabric.
Through building practice and interdisciplinary research projects, Jing has led SO – IL to explore new fabrication methods — as in Kukje Gallery and CTF Museum — and engage with the sociopolitical issues of contemporary cities — in projects like the Artists Loft North Omaha and Frieze Art Fair. Her perspective extends outside conventional architecture, with artist collaborations including Janaina Tschape and Kota Yamada; curatorial partnership at the London Design Museum; and book projects such as Solid Objectives: Order, Edge, Aura published by Lars Müller.</p>
<p>Jing extends her interest in the future of cities as an active board member of the Van Alen Institute, a nonprofit that applies design research to pressing social and cultural challenges of tomorrow.</p>
