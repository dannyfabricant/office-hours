<p>Luckily the (possible) moonshine we served didn't kill Sue, Hannah and Sarah at the beginning of the interview so we could hear about their awesome Asian power women pursuits.</p>

<p>Sue, Hannah and Sarah's interview originally aired on November 7, 2018.</p>

<p>Industry veteran Sue S. Chan was the Brand Director of Momofuku for seven years before founding Care of Chan in 2016. After graduating from Barnard College, she worked in external relations for the Food Bank For New York City, a hunger relief organization that feeds over a quarter of a million New Yorkers a day. Sue is also the co-founder of Toklas Society, a not-for-profit group for women in food and hospitality to find inspiration, mentorship, and community. She has been named one of Marie Claire magazine’s “Fresh Faces in Food” and received a Young Alumna Award for Outstanding Achievement in Her Field from Barnard College of Columbia University. Care of Chan was named one of Observer’s “Most Powerful Restaurant PR Firms” in 2018, just after two-years in operation.</p>

<p>In 2014, Hannah Cheng and her sister Marian opened the first Mimi Cheng's in New York's East Village, serving the authentic, delicious Taiwanese dumplings they grew up with. Hannah found her path to dumplings by way of Wall Street. With a degree from Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, Hannah worked on the trading floor at J.P. Morgan for close to eight years before launching Mimi Cheng’s with her sister, Marian, who previously worked in the fashion industry. In 2016, Mimi Cheng’s expanded to their second location in Nolita. The Cheng sisters have been featured in notable media outlets including Bon Appetit, Vogue, New York Magazine, and Forbes and the duo have been included in Zagat’s 30 Under 30.</p>

<p>Sarah Law is the founder and designer of KARA, a NYC based accessories label founded in 2013. Born in California and raised in Hong Kong, she moved to New York to study Fashion Design at Parsons The New School for Design. Her line, inspired by her background of being Chinese and Caucasian growing up in an international community, celebrates self expression, diversity and complexity found within identity. </p>
